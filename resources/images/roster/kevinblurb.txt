Kevin QA'd software at Apple during the dark days of the Spindler/Amelio era and his division was eliminated 6 months after Steve Jobs returned.  He also served in the Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer and has sailed through every time zone between California and the Middle East at least 2 times.
When not pulling his hair out because his code won't work, he enjoys fixing bicycles and found a company foolish enough to pay him (poorly) to do it.
